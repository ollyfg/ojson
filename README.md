# ojson README

In addition to the regular JSON beutifying, this plugin lets you parse to and
from JS literals, eg:

```javascript
{
  "arrays": [
    "work",
    "fine",
    "too"
  ],
  "foo": "bar"
}
// Becomes
{
  arrays: [
    "work",
    "fine",
    "too"
  ],
  foo: "bar"
}
// And vice-versa
```
